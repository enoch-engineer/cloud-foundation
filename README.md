# Cloud Engineering Journey – Day 1

## What I Did Today
- Installed WSL2 on Windows 11
- Installed Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- Restarted the computer to complete installation
- Launched Ubuntu for the first time
- Created my Linux username and password

## Why This Matters
This is the foundation of my cloud engineering environment.  
All future Linux, Docker, Terraform, and AWS work will be done here.

## Commands I Used
- `wsl --install -d Ubuntu`
- `ls`, `pwd`, `cd`
- `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`

## Lessons Learned
- WSL2 gives me a real Linux environment inside Windows.
- Cloud engineers rely heavily on Linux, so this is step one.

## Next Steps
- Learn basic Linux commands
- Set up my development environment
- Start my first Bash script
